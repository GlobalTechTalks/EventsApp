All the necessary middleware will be present inside this folder.
Naming convention of the files will be in similar fashion as done in rest of the project ie camelCase.

We will be requiring middlewares for following things:

- Request Initialization :white_check_mark:
- Session check
- User permission check
- Missing & invalid input check
- Mongo id validation
- Basic auth validation
- Rate limiter
